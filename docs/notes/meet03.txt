1. Given polynomial f(x1, x2, ... , xn) <= r, construct a CNF for it. (Think)

2. Smallest formula(length or no. of variables) for x_1 + x_2 + ... + xn <= r.
(Think)

3. Read form `Learning formula' before `Backtracking'.

   Learning a boolean function: Have a record of input and output. Have to
   determine the function. Construct a satisfying formula for DNF that may
   capture the function.

   Bounded model checking: Consider a transition system. Constructs initial
   states and transition relation in a satisfying formula. Checks it it reaches
   any state with some property.

    - Game of Life, John Conway: If any initial configuration reaches a
      particular configuration.

      Also, JS implementation of Conway's Game of Life by Ranadeep at

    - Applications to mutual exclusions: Detecting mutual exclusion, progress,
      starvation, deadlock using SAT solver.

   Digital tomography: Consider an image with binary pixel value. Row, column,
   diagonal sums are given. It is possible to reconstruct the original image?
   Generally, no. eg. Cheshire cat. The solutions are nowhere similar to the
   original image.
