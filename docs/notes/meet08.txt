SAT solving using resolution.

1. Guess and decide all forced decisions.
2. If conflicts, add resolved clause and backtrack the original guess.
3. Repeat until no more guessing.

Key idea
	Resolved clauses are helpful to prune the `search tree'. But it would
add many many resolved clauses. So adding small number of small sized resolved
clauses is the main trick.
