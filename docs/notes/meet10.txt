1. Encoding constraints into clauses.
	- encode constraints for real life problem to CNF
	- different encodings works well for different problems
	- different algorithms works well with different encodings

2. Unit propagation and forcing.

3. symmetry breaking
	- using constrainsts force satisfying assignment to be unique.
	- prunes many unnecessary symmetric branches
