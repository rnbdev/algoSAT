Completed reading backtracking algorithms.

Random satisfiability.

1. q_m = Pr(m distinct random clauses of k-SAT on n variables are SAT)

2. T_m = number of ways to make m distinct random clauses of k-SAT on n variables to be SAT.
    - mean, variance

3. Pr(T_m = 1)

4. P = number of distinct clauses of k-SAT to become UNSAT
    - P is a random variable.
    - Pr(P = m) = p_m = q_{m-1} - q_m
    - mean and variances for P

5. S_{k, n} = E[P_{k, n}]

6. q'_m = Pr(m random clauses of k-SAT are SAT)
    - clauses can repeat
    - q_m <= q'_m

7. P' = number of clauses of k-SAT to become UNSAT
    - P' is random variable
    - Pr(P = m) = p'_m = q'_{m-1} = q'_m
    - mean and variances for P

8. S_k(m, n) = Pr(m random clauses of k-SAT are SAT)

9. Satisfiability thresholds, Phase transition
    - a_k = lim_{n -> infty} S_{k, n}/n
    - for 3SAT a_3 ~= 4.27

10. Analysis for 2SAT
    - a_2 = 1
