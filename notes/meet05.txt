1. Backtracking using watchee.
   If a formula is satisfiable, each clause must have a positive literal. We
   will call it as `watchee` for each clause. Note a literal is watchee, its
   dual must not be a watchee.   
   
   Roughly the algo is, start with some arbitary watchee for each clause. They
   need not to be consistent. Actually the algorithm tries to make them
   consistent.

   * implemented this algorithm.

2. Read satisfiability with cyclic DPLL.
