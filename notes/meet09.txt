Randomized methods

1. Monte Carlo algorithm
	- guess an assignment
	- if all clauses are satisfiable, exit successfully.
	- else, choose a literal randomly, and make it to be true.
	- do this, till maximum N iteration, then exit unsuccessfully.

2. WalkSAT
	- modified Monte Carlo
	- guess an assignment
	- if all clauses are satisfiable, exit successfully
	- else, if least cost is zero or with some probability,
		- choose a random lowest cost literal and flip it
		- else choose any random literal and flip it
	- do this, till maximum N iteration, then exit unsuccessfully.
