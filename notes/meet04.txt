1. Satisfiability using backtracking.
   Guesses an incremental solution and tries to satisfy all clauses.
   If formula becomes unsat for a solution, it backtracks and tries for new 
   solution till no other new solution is available.

   * implemented this algorithm.

2. `m` increase lexicographically.
   because, m_i's are increasing. their lifetimes are one of the followings -
   000 -> 011 ; 001 -> 010 ; 100 ;101

3. Read satisfiability using watchee.
